# About

This was a project based opn taking a dataset of Crypto Currency price changes and using machine learning to cluster them into related groups.  First the the dat was prepared using StandardScaler() to normalize the data.  Then it was modelled
and fit using the optimal value for number of clusters and displayed using a scatterplot.  The next step was to optimize the clusters using Principal Component Analysis to create clearer clusters.  Finally both sets of graphs were displayed
side by side to compare the differences in methods.
